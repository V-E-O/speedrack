=========

Speedrack is a single-node cron system with an attractive web interface, job-tracking and configurable notification via email. It's not the task runner you need, but it might be the one you deserve.

It is intended to drive regular executions of low-resource shell scripts, routing output to defined locations. The web front end makes it easy to see a high-level overview. It's convenient and easy.
